        "1.The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object: An instance of a class. It is a specific entity that has the attributes and behaviors defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: The concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components. This is achieved through access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: The mechanism by which one class (called a subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors from another class (called a superclass or base class). It allows for code reusability and the creation of hierarchical relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: The ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways. It can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism). This allows for flexible and extensible code.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts form the foundation of OOP and help in creating modular, reusable, and scalable software.\n"
